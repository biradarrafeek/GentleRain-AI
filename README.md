# GentleRain.ai Clone 🌧️

A modern, animated front-end clone inspired by **GentleRain.ai**, built to practice advanced UI interactions using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and Locomotive Scroll**.

This project focuses on smooth scrolling, parallax effects, horizontal scrolling sections, card flip animations, and subtle motion design.

## 📌 Features

* Smooth scrolling using **Locomotive Scroll**
* Scroll-based animations with **GSAP + ScrollTrigger**
* Parallax layered hero section
* Rotating hero text animation
* 3D flip cards for feature highlights
* Horizontal scroll section pinned on vertical scroll
* Responsive design for mobile & tablet

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – semantic structure
* **CSS3** – animations, gradients, 3D transforms
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – interaction logic
* **GSAP 3** – animations
* **GSAP ScrollTrigger** – scroll-based animation control
* **Locomotive Scroll** – smooth scrolling & scroll events

## 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

This project was developed with assistance from **AI tools** for learning and productivity purposes.

### AI Tools Used

* **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

  * Helped generate:

    * Animation logic ideas (GSAP & ScrollTrigger)
    * Code structure suggestions
    * README documentation
    * Best practices for smooth scrolling integration

> All generated code was **reviewed, modified, and integrated manually** by the developer.

---

### Visual Assets

* All gradients and visual effects are created using **pure CSS**
* No external images or proprietary assets were used

---

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

* Advanced scroll-based animation workflows
* Synchronizing GSAP with custom scroll engines
* Creating immersive UI experiences
* Structuring animation-heavy front-end projects
